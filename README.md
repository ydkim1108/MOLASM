## üîß System Overview

The **MOLASM (Mobile Laser Steering Module)** is a MEMS-based wireless optical power transmitter designed to enable far-field battery-less sensor operation.

This system integrates:

- Electrothermal MEMS Micromirror for 2D laser beam steering  
- 650 nm Laser Diode for optical power transmission  
- PWM-controlled actuation via **ATtiny85**  
- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for wireless control  
- Inductive Wireless Power Module (HiPDiM) for full untethered operation
